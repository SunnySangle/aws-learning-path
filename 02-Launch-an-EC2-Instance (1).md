Launch an EC2 Instance
Learn how to launch and connect to an EC2 instance. This step-by-step guide covers the essential steps to get your instance up and running.
Steps to Launch an Instance
1.	Sign in to AWS Management Console
o	Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
2.	Launch Instance
o	Click "Launch Instance" to start the instance creation wizard.
3.	Choose AMI
o	Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Options include:
	Amazon Linux 2
	Ubuntu Server

Connecting to Your Instance
•	Linux: Use SSH:
•	ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
•	
Windows: Use Remote Desktop (RDP). Download the RDP file and use the password generated during instance launch.
Example Use Case
Development: Developers use EC2 instances to test new applications before deploying them to production.
Certification Tips
Practice launching and configuring instances: Key for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect and AWS Certified DevOps Engineer exams.
